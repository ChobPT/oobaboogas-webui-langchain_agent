# oobaboogas-webui-langchain_agent
Creates an Langchain Agent which uses the WebUI's API and Wikipedia to work

Tested to be barely working, I learned python a couple of weeks ago, bear with me.

Needs ´api´ and ´no_stream´ enabled.

Install with ´pip install -r requirements.txt´ (go to the extensions folder first and do  ´git clone https://github.com/ChobPT/oobaboogas-webui-langchain_agent/ webui_langchain_agent´)

To trigger simply add /do before the instructions so that you can continue the conversation later on with the context

You can basically enable the tools by just using the documentation basics at https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html and then add the respective tools at

Tested with anon8231489123_vicuna-13b-GPTQ-4bit-128g using the Instruct >  Vicuna-V1 with Llamma Precise parameters

Again, just learned python recently, it kind of works, but it's a start

cheers!
